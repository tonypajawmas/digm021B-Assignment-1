    <h2>Hi, Sergio!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm excited to be in another one of your classes. This break was an
      interesting one to say the least. My roommates got COVID-19, so I was
      stuck inside isolating most of the time. Needless to say, I am happy to be
      back and to be able to go to campus again.
      <br />
      I'm ready to learn more about other aspects of web development that I have
      yet to learn. One thing I'm looking forward to learning about is how to
      properly adapt sites to a mobile platform. That's something that I know is
      very important these days. I'm also hoping to find out more about other
      forms of code like CSS and how they are implemented.
